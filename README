WHAT IS IT?

As a programming exercise for learning Python, I wrote a simple rwhois
server.  It uses in-memory data structures, and it intuits
the schema based on the data it sees.  The server as input takes a
schema file, which for now just describes which attributes should be
indexed (and how), and data files which look much like the C rwhoisd's
data files.

REQUIREMENTS

python 2.2 or later

INSTALL

For now, just run it from the source directory:


RUNNING IT

% tar zxvf python-rwhoisd-0.1.tar.gz

% cd python-rwhoisd-0.1

% ./bin/pyrwhoisd sample_data/example_schema \
                  sample_data/example_data &

Voila!  You should now have some sort of rwhois server running on port
4321

CONFIGURING IT

Edit rwhoisd/config.py.
This file is sort of commented as to what you can change.


DATA

See the example_schema and example_data files in the sample_data
directory.
